kadnode (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * rename --ifce to --ifname, it is less obscure
  * ignore quotation marks in configuration files
  * remove finished searches with no results immediately
  * fix the number of exported addresses, the calculation was wrong
  * free all resources on (regular) shutdown
  * [AUTH] make sure to send auth requests as soon as sheduled

kadnode (0.9.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * add FreeBSD package
  * add Windows package
  * add Windows support (via Cygwin)
  * add support for Windows services
    * add "---service-start", "--service-install" and "--service-remove"
  * fix IPv4 localhost address byte order when resolving own value
  * [NSS] add FreeBSD support

      so this will hopefully speed up other requests
