This tool translates hostnames to IPv6/IPv4 addresses
using P2P technology. Every user can announce
various hostnames and can resolve these hostnames
on other computers running KadNode.
KadNode wraps the Kademlia DHT implementation
and offers support for the Name Service Switch (NSS)
facility. The package also includes a control program
called kadnode-ctl.
